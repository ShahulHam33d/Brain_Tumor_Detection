# Brain_Tumor_Detection

Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.

### Objective:
To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

Dataset: (Kaggle dataset)
https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri
the dataset folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders.
Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes.
